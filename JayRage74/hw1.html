    <h1>Who is Jesus Cardona?</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jesus Cardona. I'm 24 years old, currently employed as
      a RX technician for HEB, and trying to change my career and become a full
      stack web developer. I have a nine month old son named Mason and a beautiful
      girlfriend named Jessica that mean the world to me, and they're a big
      reason for my career change.</p>
    <h1>What?</h1>
    <p> What I am trying to do is become a full stack developer. I saw a video
      on youtube that caught my eye, and in the video the youtuber discusses how
       he learned how to code and how he got a job as a front end web developer.
     The video quickly interested me, so I viewed other videos about coding and
     I quickly became hooked and wanted to learn how to code.
     <h1>How?</h1>
     <p>So I started viewing other videos on how to code and learned little
       about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Since I had no prior knowledge about web
        development everything was foreign and made no sense to me. I viewed
        another video on youtube about coding bootcamps and I quickly googled
      coding bootcamps in San Antonio. Fortunately, I came across SCI/Coder Camps.
    I talked to sci recruiter Dean and was quickly enrolled. Hopefully, by the
    end of the program I can take my new skill set and get hired as a full stack
     developer and have a promising career.  </p>
    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p>Even though I have no prior knowledge in web development, with all the
      research I did on youtube, google and even the free courses online I developed
       a passion to learn how to code and learn everything there is to learn about
        programming/coding/web development. Not only was my new passion to learn
        to code a reason to become a full stack web developer, but Mason and
        Jessica are the biggest reasons I'm taking this huge leap of faith and
        changing my career. I want to give them a better life and I want Mason
        to live a better life than I did growing up in the west side of
        San Antonio.They are my biggest supporters and I will not let them
        down.</p>
        <h1>My goals</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Master html,css, javascript</li>
          <li>Complete the SCI/Coder camps program</li>
          <li>Land a job as a full stack web developer in Austin or San Antonio</li>
          <li>Buy Jessica and Mason a home</li>
          <li>Launch a million dollar app</li>
          <li>Work for Google.....Hopefully.</li>
        </ul>
