    <h1>My Why?</h1>
    <p>The reason that keeps me going is for my 14 year old daughter Mia.
      Currently I am going thru a long hard divorce for the last 4 years.
      The transition has been hard on the both of us, but she is my why because I want
      to show her that no matter how hard things maybe you can make it thru. On Monday,
      prayerfully things will be resolved and I will be able to rebuild from the past 4 years.</p>
    <h1>My How</h1>
    <p>About 4 years ago Veterans Administration told me that they would pay for a year
      of schooling from a list of qualified programs. I was led into an Associates for Information
      Technology thru an online courses. I was 8 credits shy of completion when I found out that the school
      did not have internship program, which led me to try and find one myself. I was disappointed
      but not deterred. I asked around about different computer technical fields and I was told to look into
      the coding bootcamps for programming. I found one that was for 8 weeks but needed $8000 before I could begin,
      well I don't have that kind of money and than I googled SCI. I called and spoke with Dean
      and he told me that I didnt need to pay up front and I could workout a payment plan. So here I am</p>
      <h1>What</h1>
        <p>I know that learning coding will be difficult and I am up for the challenge.
          To me learning coding is just like learning a new language with a whole lot of LOGIC.
          I learned a phrase that Ive used throughout my life. "The 6 P's of LIfe."
          The P's are Prior Planning Prevents Pretty Poor Perfomance. To be successful
          in learning coding I needed to open my mind and not think of what I know but be open. Write plenty of notes
          Ask questions, even if it sounds stupid. Come to class everyday ready to learn something new.
          I know I will have it harder than anyone else because Im older and slower, but it will not stop me from
          learning this coding.</p>
